Task
**4 - Dictionary for storing data and make efficient calculations**
This is an expansion of the exercise nr. 3 of the list exercises. Same situation, we want to
use this cool 'input'-function:
```python
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
greeting = "Hello, " + user_name + "!"
print(greeting)
```

- Write a program that asks the user 3 questions:
    - their name,
    - the date of today
    - their daily hours of work of this day,
    - their money spent on lunch at this day.

- This time think about a dictionary structure to store all values that are entered. What makes sense to store as key and what as values? 
*hint:* name should be definetly a key.
- Then, write a for-loop that loops through all keys and calculates the sum of all daily hours worked so far and the average lunch expenses.
- Print out the result to us in a nicely formatted way. 
(If you want to be really pythonic, try to use string formatting with the format-method and f-strings.)

Optional task:
- add a feature that let's the user tell you to delete a certain element if it was wrong.

#here are my codes:

# 1. definition
database = {}
user_name = []
date_today = []
y = 0

# 2. log_In
user_name_input = input("Enter your name: ")
date_today_input = input("Date of today: ")
daily_hours_input = float(input("hours worked today: "))
lunch_expenses_input = float(input ("lunch_expenses: "))
greeting = "Hello, " + user_name_input + "!"
print(greeting)
#
# 3. Database
if not user_name_input in user_name:
    user_name.append(user_name_input)
if not date_today_input in date_today:
    date_today.append(date_today_input)
log_in_input = user_name_input + " " + date_today_input
database [log_in_input] = {"n":user_name_input,"d":date_today_input,
                           "h":daily_hours_input,"m":lunch_expenses_input}

# 4. Display
# Then, write a for-loop that loops through all keys and
# calculates the sum of all daily hours worked so far and the average lunch expenses.
for x in user_name:
    print (x)
    sum_h = 0
    sum_m = 0
    count_of_date = 0
    for y in date_today:
        if x + " " + y in database :
           sum_h += database[x + " " + y]["h"]
           sum_m += database[x + " " + y]["m"]
           count_of_date += 1 
           print(database[x + " " + y]["d"],":",database[x + " " + y]["h"],"hours",database[x + " " + y]["m"],"€")
        else:
            pass
    print(f'You worked {sum_h} hours in {count_of_date} days and spent {sum_m/count_of_date}€ per day in average.')

# 5. delete wrong items
wrong_input = input("Enter your name: ") + " "+ input("On which date was wrong: ")
database.pop(wrong_input)
print(database)
